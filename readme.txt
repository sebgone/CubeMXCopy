Steps for copy or rename projects automatically:

1. Move script to your CubeMX workspace directory.
2. Open cmd in that directory.
3. Run the script with three arguments: option "name of existing project" "name of new project".
   option: -r for renaming
   option: -c for copying
   ex: CubeMXCopy -r "example directory" "new directory".
4. Import new project directory by CubeMX IDE.
5. Continue working on your new instance of a project.
